We had a nice self-driving travel of two days in Xiling Snow Mountain. It was very lucky that some wild monkeys appeared on our way uphill at the first day, they looked friendly but people had better not disturd them. A partner was attacked by a monkey in Emei Mountain several years ago because some candies looked delicious packed in her bag, and the monkey robbed her. It was sunny at the second day, a magnificent scene - the sea of clouds - jumped into our eyes.

## Education

*   Sep, 2014 - Present 
    
    Master at Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University

    (Expected Graduation: Mar, 2017)

*   Sep, 2010 - June, 2014 
    
    Bachelar at Computer Science, Centrol South University

## Workding Experience

*   June, 2016 - Present

    Algorithm Engineer Intern at [dianping](http://dianping.com){:target="_blank"} (大众点评)
    
    Focus on recommendation algorithm.

    1. User-based collaborative filtering. (Hadoop + Hive)

        Recommendation on group buying (团购) using user-based CF algorithm, using MapReduce cause the large quantity of historical records. For more details, see the [An Introduction of User-based Collaborative Filtering](/user_based_collabrative_filtering).

*   Mar, 2015 - Jan, 2016
    
    Software Development Engineer Intern at [TouchPal](http://touchpal.com){:target="_blank"}
    
    Focus on big data, through Hadoop and its eco-system(HBase, Pig, etc.) and Spark. 

    1. A off-line data process platform. (Hadoop + Hbase)

        Using Hadoop Streaming to computing, Hbase to store historical data, including Python, Pig, MapReduce.

    2. A real-time data process platform.(Kafka + Spark + Cassandra)
    
        Let Kafka be the input source of data, start a Spark Streaming job to get Dstream from Kafka, insert into Cassandra to discard some reduplicative record and backup all records. Another job gets the data newly inserted from Cassandra and make a statistic every an interval. Finally, update the total statistic. For more detail, see the [Real Time Data Process Platform](/real-time-data-process-platform).

    3. Project of TouchPal Internship Hackathon 2015

        We have 24 hours to develop an AI to play a game named Battle Line. Finally our team get the **second place** of seven teams. For more detail and source code, please see the [Battleline-AI](/BattleLine-AI){:target="_blank"}.
